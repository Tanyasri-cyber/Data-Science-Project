# IT Support Ticket Resolution Predictor

This project predicts the resolution time for IT support tickets and groups them into clusters for better analysis. 
It combines machine learning (regression) for prediction and unsupervised learning (clustering) for insights. 
A Streamlit dashboard is included to visualize and interact with the data.


## üìÇ Project Flow

1. **Data Collection**

   * Input data comes from an IT helpdesk system containing ticket details such as queue, software, hardware, assigned staff, and resolution time.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Missing values in the target column are removed.
   * Categorical fields are encoded into numeric values using Label Encoding.

3. **Clustering**

   * Ticket data is standardized and grouped into 3 clusters using KMeans.
   * Helps to identify patterns in ticket categories and resolution trends.

4. **Dashboard (Streamlit)**

   * Interactive visualizations of resolution times, clusters, and queues.
   * Users can upload new data and get prediction results.
